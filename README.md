# ML-models-from-scratch

Implementing Linear Regression From Scratch using Gradient Descent. 

K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). 
KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970's as a non-parametric technique.
I have Implemented KNN from scratch using only Numpy and Pandas
